Community Templates
create-vite is a tool to quickly start a project from a basic template for popular frameworks. Check out Awesome Vite for community maintained templates that include other tools or target different frameworks.

For a template at https://github.com/user/project, you can try it out online using https://github.stackblitz.com/user/project (adding .stackblitz after github to the URL of the project).

You can also use a tool like degit to scaffold your project with one of the templates. Assuming the project is on GitHub and uses main as the default branch, you can create a local copy using:

```shell

npx degit user/project#main my-project
cd my-project

npm install
npm run dev

```
